# Obra Facebook Ad Campaign

Five scroll-stopping Facebook ad creatives targeting problem-aware construction contractors.

---

## AD 1: "THE LOST JOB"
**Pain point: Quoting speed**

### Primary Text
You're on the roof when the phone rings. New client. Sounds like a $4,800 job. You say you'll send a quote tomorrow.

Tomorrow turns into three days. By the time you text back, they already hired someone else.

Obra sends quotes in 60 seconds. From WhatsApp. While you're still on the ladder.

Never lose another job to a slow quote.

### Headline
Lost a job because you were too busy?

### Description
Obra quotes in 60 seconds

### Targeting
- **Audience:** Solo contractors, small crew owners (painters, roofers, general contractors, handymen)
- **Location:** US metro areas with high construction activity (Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, Miami, LA)
- **Age:** 28-50
- **Interests:** Home improvement, small business, construction, roofing, painting
- **Behavior:** Small business owners, engaged shoppers
- **Time:** Run during lunch (11am-1pm) and after work (5pm-8pm) when they're scrolling
- **Season:** Year-round (this is the #1 pain point)

## AD 2: "THE RECEIPT SHOEBOX"
**Pain point: Tax season chaos**

### Primary Text
Your CPA charges you an extra $800 every year. Know why?

Because your receipts are in a shoebox. Or stuffed in the truck. Or "somewhere."

You spend two weeks trying to remember which Home Depot trip was for which job. Your CPA charges hourly for the mess.

Obra tracks every receipt the second you snap it. WhatsApp. Done. Your CPA will actually thank you.

### Headline
Receipts in a shoebox again?

### Description
Never lose a receipt. $99/mo.

### CTA Button

### Targeting
- **Audience:** Same core as Ad 1, but emphasize those in business 2+ years (more tax pain)
- **Location:** Same
- **Age:** 32-55 (slightly older, more established)
- **Interests:** Small business, accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping
- **Time:** Run heavy Jan-Apr (tax season), lighter rest of year

## AD 3: "THE $99 OFFICE MANAGER"
**Value proposition: Office help replacement**

### Primary Text
You've thought about hiring someone to handle quotes, follow up on leads, keep your paperwork straight.

Good luck finding someone for less than $3,000/month. And they'll call in sick. And quit right when you need them.

Obra is $99/month. Never calls in sick. Never quits. Works 24/7. Lives in WhatsApp.

It's not software. It's the office manager you can actually afford.

### Headline
$99/mo office manager that never quits

### Description
Cheaper than hiring. Better than software.

No apps. No logins. No complicated software.

Just WhatsApp. The same app you already use every day.

### Headline

### Description

## NOTES FOR MEDIA BUYER

- Use these HTML files to generate 1080x1080px screenshots for upload
- A/B test CTA buttons: "Learn More" vs "Send Message" 
- Watch for ad fatigue — rotate creatives every 2-3 weeks
- Track cost per landing page visit AND cost per WhatsApp conversation start
- Exclude people who already signed up (once you have a pixel/conversion tracking)
- Consider lookalike audiences once you have 100+ conversions
